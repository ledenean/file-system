# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to store all the code for the Linux file system. 

The program emulates the file system of a Linux operating system. The purpose of the program is to manage the data storage within the Linux operating system on the disk. It allows a user to be able to manage files and directories with the ability to open, close, move, remove, and create files. 

The file system uses 10,000,000 or less (minimum 500,000) bytes for the volume size and 512 bytes per sector. The file system contains information about directories and files such as name, size, creation date, file type, and location. It also includes the Volume Control Block, directory entry system, free space management, directory-based functions, and file operations.
